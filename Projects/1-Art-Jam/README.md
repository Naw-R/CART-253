## Description
This is an interactive game where the player uses the mouse to push a bouncing ball away. 
The ball moves dynamically and changes direction when it comes close to the edges of the canvas 
or interacts with the player's cursor. The player can influence the ball's movement by hovering near it, 
creating an engaging avoidance gameplay experience.
