## Description
This is an interactive game where the player controls a red ball with the mouse to influence the movement of a bouncing blue ball. The blue ball moves dynamically within a boundary, changing direction when it hits the edges or when it’s repelled by the red ball. The closer the player’s cursor gets to the blue ball, the stronger the push effect, creating a fun and engaging challenge as the player tries to control and avoid the blue ball’s movements.
