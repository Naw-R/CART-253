/**
 * Art Jam Project
 * Author : Rowan Nasser
 * For the class : CART 253 A 2242 (Fall 2024)
 * For the teacher : Pippin Barr
 * 
 * Date of Creation : September 19th 2024
 * Due Date ; October 3rd 2024
 * 
 * The project is about a Blue ball that bounces over the Boundary defined by the black square
 * The goal is to make the Blue ball bounce away from the Red ball cursor
 * 
 * Objectives :
 * Get comfortable with starting, coding, and distributing a simple JavaScript project 
 * Develop familiarity with the p5 library and its drawing functions and variables in particular 
 * Build confidence in understanding variables both in terms of how they work and how they can contribute to expressive work
 * 
 * Brief : 
 * Use variables to create change of different kinds (movement, scale, colour, and more)
 * Use mouseX and mouseY to allow for some user interaction/input
 * Use p5â€™s map() function in some capacity (learn about it by reading the map() reference page)
 * Use at least one conditional to make the program respond to a changing variable
 *
