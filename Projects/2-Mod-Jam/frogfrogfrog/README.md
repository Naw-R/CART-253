# Brief

Starting with the Frogfrogfrog Project, the following features were added:

- **Sound Effects:** Background music, frog sound, buzzing sound, and power-up sounds enhance the experience.
- **Scoring System:** Tracks the player's progress with a goal of catching 10 flies.
- **Game States:** Intro, playing, win, and loss screens for a structured flow.
- **Timer:** A 40-second countdown adds urgency to the gameplay.
- **Difficulty Adjustment:** Fly speed increases every 3 flies to increase challenge.
- **Moving Clouds:** Animated clouds in the background for visual appeal.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Frog movement with arrow keys and A/D keys; tongue launch with the spacebar.
- **Mouse Control Tracking:** Added logic to track recent mouse movement for smoother interaction.
- **Particles System:** Created a particle explosion effect when a fly is caught to enhance visual feedback.
- **Restart Button:** Added a restart button to allow players to easily restart the game from the win or loss screens.
