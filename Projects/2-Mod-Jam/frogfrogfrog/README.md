# Objectives

Building strength with the basics of JavaScript, particularly variables, conditionals, and events
Developing a sense of how a more complex program works and how to make changes to it systematically
Finding surprising ways to change a conventional design through programming specifically

# Brief

Starting with the Frogfrogfrog Project. Add a minimum of a further five (but ideally more) new features to the experience. Examples might include:

Sound Effects (Background sound, Frog sound, Buzzing sound, PowerUps sounds).
A scoring system.
Improved Frog features (Adding eyes and pupils).
Improved Fly appearance (Wings animation, body, eyes, legs).
Moving Clouds.
